``pulp_rpm`` Plugin
===================

The ``pulp_rpm`` plugin extends `pulpcore <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulpcore/>`__ to support
hosting RPM family content types. This plugin is a part of the `Pulp Project
<http://www.pulpproject.org>`_, and assumes some familiarity with the `pulpcore documentation
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/>`_.


To get started, check the :doc:`installation docs<installation>` and take a look at the :doc:`basic
