Pulp 2.17 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.17.0
===========

New Features
------------

* The `gpg_key_id` yum distributor configuration value was previously ignored
  unless `gpg_cmd` was configured.  It is now used with the default GPG signing
  command when `gpg_cmd` is not configured.

* The export distributor now generates a ``*.iso.DIGESTS`` file along with the ISO.
  This file will contain md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, and sha512 digests of the ISO.
