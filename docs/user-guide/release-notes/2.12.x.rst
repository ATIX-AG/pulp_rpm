New Features

* RPMs are now being published into new folder structure e.g. "Packages/d/dnf.rpm". This applies
  to all RPMs which will be published after this update, even during incremental publish in a repo
  with the old folder structure. Incremental publishes will place newly-added RPMs into
  the new folder structure while leaving previously-published RPMs in the old locations. This is
  safe and correct. If you prefer to have all RPMs published in the new layout, simply perform
  a full publish on each repository.
