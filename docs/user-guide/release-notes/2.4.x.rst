Pulp 2.4 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.4.0
==========

New Features
------------

Yum Distributor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The yum distributor plugin has bee re-written to remove its dependencies on yum and createrepo
and to consume significantly less memory when publishing large repositories.

The new yum distributor now lays published repositories out on disk differently:

 * HTTP and HTTPS served repositories are now found under the /var/lib/pulp/published/yum/ directory
 * The new directory /var/lib/pulp/published/yum/master contains the actual published repository files
 * The generated repodata metadata files are no longer prefixed with their checksum

API Changes
-----------

Yum Importer
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When uploading RPMs, the unit key and metadata no longer need to be extracted client-side
and passed to the server. The server will inspect the RPM and extract the necessary information.

Yum metadata files can now be uploaded to a repository. Information on valid metadata
attributes can be found in the technical reference.

Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

Make sure to run the `pulp-manage-db` command so that you upgrade your rpm support to version `15`.

Please see the
`Pulp Platform upgrade instructions <https://pulp-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/pulp-2.4/release-notes.html>`_
for information on how to complete the upgrade.
