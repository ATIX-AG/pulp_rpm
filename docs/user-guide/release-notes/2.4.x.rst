Pulp 2.4 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.4.0
==========

New Features
------------

 - Added the ability to generate sqlite repository metadata files as part of an RPM repo
   publish.


API Changes
-----------
 - The ``generate_sqlite`` metadata flag was added to the yum_distributor distributor type.
   Enabling that flag will turn on generation of sqlite repo metadata files.  This is not
   enabled by default.
 - Removed the ``use_createrepo`` in favor of the more precise ``generate_sqlite`` flag

Yum Importer
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When uploading RPMs, the unit key and metadata no longer need to be extracted client-side
and passed to the server. The server will inspect the RPM and extract the necessary information.

Yum metadata files can now be uploaded to a repository. Information on valid metadata
attributes can be found in the technical reference.

Upgrade Instructions
