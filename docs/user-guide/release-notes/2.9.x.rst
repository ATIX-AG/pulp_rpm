Pulp 2.9 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.9.0
==========

New Features
------------

* Now it is possible to upload ``package_environment`` element via CLI and API.
* Publication of the RPMs can now be done non-incrementally using ``--force-full`` option.
* The <langpacks> tag in comps.xml are synced and published for repositories. These units are also
  parsed on upload. ``pulp-admin`` also has upload, remove, and search support for 
  package_langpacks.
* The yum distributor and export distributor now use the configured checksum type for all repo
  metadata. The pulp-admin repo "create" and "update" commands now save the specified checksum type
  on both distributors.
* Repoview support is added. The ability to generate HTML files to browse a repository can be
  enabled by using ``--repoview`` option for the yum_distributor.
