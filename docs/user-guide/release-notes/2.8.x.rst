Pulp 2.8 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.8.0
==========

New Features
------------

* The default Apache configuration has changed in order to support deferred content
  downloading. All requests to ``/pulp/repos`` are now re-written to ``/pulp/content``.

Database Changes
----------------

The 2.8.0 release comes with strong validation enabled at the database layer. This required some
database changes to be made. These changes should go unnoticed for most users, however, for those
users integrating with Pulp in a deep way, this may affect you. This section recaps known changes.

Database Field Type Modifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following collections and fields have had some data quality fixes applied to avoid validation
issues.

========================= ====================== ============================================
Collection                Field Name             Data Quality Fix
========================= ====================== ============================================
units_package_category    translated_name        Previous values of "" are now {}
units_package_category    translated_description Previous values of "" are now {}
units_package_environment translated_name        Previous values of "" are now {}
units_package_environment translated_description Previous values of "" are now {}
units_package_group       translated_name        Previous values of "" are now {}
units_package_group       translated_description Previous values of "" are now {}
units_erratum             pushcount              All int and floats converted to strings. All
                                                 null values are unset.
========================= ====================== ============================================


Database Fields Renamed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The database has renamed some field names for RPM unit models. This change should not be noticeable
through the API, but it does come with a migration which drops some indexes. The following field
names are renamed:

=========================  ==============  ======================
Collection                 Old Field Name  New Field Name
=========================  ==============  ======================
units_distribution         id              distribution_id
units_erratum              from            errata_from
units_erratum              id              errata_id
units_package_group        id              package_group_id
units_package_category     id              package_category_id
units_package_environment  id              package_environment_id
=========================  ==============  ======================

Database Index Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following indexes have been dropped:

=========================  ==============
Collection                 Index Name
=========================  ==============
units_distribution         id_1
units_distribution         id_1_family_1_variant_1_version_1_arch_1
units_erratum              id_1
units_package_group        id_1
units_package_group        id_1_repo_id_1
units_package_category     id_1
units_package_category     id_1_repo_id_1
units_package_environment  id_1
units_package_environment  id_1_repo_id_1
=========================  ==============

Several indexes have been created, check your db to see what indexes are in place.
