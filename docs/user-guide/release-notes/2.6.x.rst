Pulp 2.6.0
==========

Bug Fixes
---------

See the list of bugs that were fixed :fixedbugs:`here <2.6.0>`.

:bz:`1153378` was addressed in 2.6.0. If
you have older (circa 2009) yum clients that fail in a way similar to what is described
:bz:`in this bug <647828#c1>`, you may want to temporarily
re-enable ``SSLInsecureRenegotation`` under ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/pulp_rpm.conf`` until your client
systems have been updated.
