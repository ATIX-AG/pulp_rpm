Bug Fixes
---------

See the list of :fixedbugs:`2.6.0`

`RHBZ #1153378 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1153378>`_ was addressed in 2.6.0. If
you have older (circa 2009) yum clients that fail in a way similar to what is described
`in this bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=647828#c1>`_, you may want to temporarily
re-enable ``SSLInsecureRenegotation`` under ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/pulp_rpm.conf`` until your client
systems have been updated.
